# KodeRunr Server written in Ruby

*NOT PRODUCTION READY* - Just a KodeRunr server example written in Rails 5 for [SRUG meetup](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-Xwgucjde/events/233509299/) talk. It's compatible with both web interface and [KodeRunr CLI](https://github.com/jaxi/koderunr/tree/master/cli).

You probably want to look into [the original KodeRunr Server written in Go](https://github.com/jaxi/koderunr/tree/master/server) in case you want something reliable and fault-tolerant.

In order make the example up and running, you need to build all the Docker images required. See https://github.com/jaxi/koderunr/blob/master/images/README.md for the building process.

## Requirements

* Rails
* Redis
* Docker
